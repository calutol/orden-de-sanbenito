                      of the Parish Council. <br />d. The spirit of governance
                      in every Parish should be that of selflessness with the
                      clergy and other leadership working together in a spirit
                      of concord, a bonded community freely and generously
                      consenting to the Lord&rsquo;s leadership under the
                      guidance of the Holy Spirit.

                    <p>
                      Summary: Worship in the OSB shall be liturgical,
                      charismatic, and evangelical with suitable vestments worn
                      by the clergy. <br />I. Liturgical <br />a. The principal
                      worship service in the OSB Church.<br />i. The service
                      shall follow the shape of the historic liturgy of the One,
                      Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. <br />ii. The
                      Eucharist shall be celebrated with the elements ordained
                      by Jesus Christ himself, Eucharistic bread and wine. The
                      normative bread in the Latin or Western Rite is an
                      unleavened wheat host with nothing beside wheat and water.
                      The Eastern Rite should use the bread normative for their
                      rite. For medical reasons gluten free bread may be used in
                      either the Western or Eastern Rites. In cases where the
                      minister suffers from alcohol sensitivities or where the
                      faithful cannot for health reason consume wine, alcohol
                      free wine may be substituted. <br />b. The approved rites
                      of the Church include those found in the Roman, Old
                      Catholic and Eastern Rites, and other traditional/historic
                      rites, as approved by the Diocesan Bishop. The Roman
                      Missal (1962), The Novus Ordo and its revisions, Revised
                      Missal Romanum (Advent 2011) The ICEL editions. The Divine
                      Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (1965). In questions of
                      interdenominational celebrations please defer to the
                      Ordinary, <br />c. In keeping with the spirit of the early
                      Church, the shape of the historic liturgy shall be
                      followed, always maintaining &ldquo;that blessed liberty
                      where with Christ hath made us free. <br />d. Vestments
                      which are suitable to an occasion of high praise should be
                      worn by the clergy. The normative attire for the principal
                      Sunday Service is: <br />i. Priests: Alb, Stole, and
                      Chasuble. <br />ii. Deacons: Alb and stole or cassock,
                      surplice and stole or deacon dalmatic. <br />e. Stoles,

                      the day along with chalice veils and burses if used.
                      Chasubles may be Gothic, Semi Gothic, Monastic or Fiddle
                      back. The following colors to be worn for Liturgy are
                      traditional but can be changed with permission from the
                      ordinary if local tradition and custom differ:

                      Advent, except when another color is specified. <br />v.
                      Dark Blue May be worn for Advent. <br />vi. Old Rose: May
                      be worn on Gaudete Sunday during Advent and Laetare Sunday
                      during Lent. <br />vii. Green: should be worn during
                      Ordinary Time. <br />viii. Blue: is worn for the Blessed
                      Virgin Mary-White may be substituted for Blue. <br />ix.

                      purple. <br />x. Black may be worn for All Souls&rsquo;
                      Day or funeral liturgies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      f. The Liturgical Colors for Services: <br />i.
                      Ordinations: White unless the color of the day is Red.
                      <br />ii. Funerals: White, Violet or Black <br />iii.

                      White or Gold
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      II. Charismatic <br />a. The worship offered to God in the
                      UCCA is not only liturgical but also charismatic. As such,
                      the worship event should lend itself to the activity of
                      the Holy Spirit in the midst of the congregation. This
                      includes freedom of prayer and praise, operation in the
                      gifts of the Holy Spirit, and regular prayer for the sick
                      accompanied by anointing of oil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      b. All worship music should bring glory to God.
                      Recognizing the various backgrounds and cultures of
                      individual parishes, it is nevertheless desirable that the
                      worship music should represent both the rich tradition of
                      the historic faith and the contemporary expression of
                      praise.
                    </p>

                    <hr />
                    <p>
                      Summary: The OSB adheres to the unity exemplified by the
                      undivided Catholic Church during the first eleven
                      centuries of its existence. <br />I. The Authority of Holy
                      Scripture <br />a. The OSB recognizes the Holy Scriptures
                      of the Old and New Testament to be the inspired Word of
                      God. <br />b. The Holy Scriptures and the Apostolic
                      Tradition serve as the authority on all matters of faith
                      and practice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      II. Catholicity <br />a. The essentials for Catholicity
                      are: <br />i. The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New
                      Testament as the inspired Word of God are the rule and
                      ultimate standard of faith. <br />ii. The Apostles Creed
                      as the Baptismal Profession and the Nicene Creed as the
                      sufficient statement of the Christian faith. <br />iii. An
                      Episcopate which must be able to trace its Apostolic
                      Succession back to the Apostles. <br />iv. The seven
                      Sacraments of the historic Catholic Church and affirmed
                      and practiced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      III. The Spirit of Theology <br />a. The OSB recognizes
                      that doctrine is not only intellectual assent but, a
                      living relationship with Almighty God and His Church.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      b. It is incumbent upon the leadership of the OSB to
                      develop and maintain an atmosphere for growth and an
                      understanding in theology and doctrine. We adhere to the
                      classical statement of ecumenicity. &ldquo;In essentials
                      unity, in non-essentials liberty, in all things
                      charity.&rdquo; While celebrating the diversity within
                      orthodoxy, we also strive to avoid a schismatic spirit
                      which would elevate non-essentials or non-consensual
                      beliefs and practices above the Father&rsquo;s will that
                      there be a spiritual and visible unity of the One, Holy,
                      Catholic and Apostolic Church.

                    <p>
                      I. Baptism <br />a. The first rite of initiation into the
                      church, which signifies the cleansing from original sin,
                      and conferral of sanctifying grace through the indwelling
                      of the Holy Spirit. The Sacrament of Baptism is only
                      administered once in a person&rsquo;s lifetime. The
                      ordinary ministers of the sacrament are Bishops, Priests,
                      or Deacons. In Extraordinary Circumstances, as in in
                      danger of death, a lay person may baptize.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      II. Confirmation <br />a. Through the anointing with oil
                      and the laying on of hands, the bishop or duly authorized
                      priest confers the graces of the Holy Spirit upon a
                      Christian. In receiving the Spirit, the Christian is
                      strengthened with the gifts needed to take on an adult
                      role in the Christian community. The Sacrament of
                      Confirmation is only administered once in a person&rsquo;s
                      lifetime. The ordinary minister of the sacrament is the
                      Diocesan Bishop or his or her designee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      III. Holy Eucharist <br />a. Holy Eucharist is the
                      celebration through which we renew and participate in
                      Christ&rsquo;s birth, sacrificial death, resurrection and
                      ascension into heaven. During this celebration we receive
                      the Real Presence of the actual Body and Blood of Christ,
                      given to us under the forms of bread and wine for our
                      spiritual nourishment. The practice of the OSB is that all
                      baptized believers are welcomed to the Table of the Lord.
                      The ordinary ministers of the sacrament are Bishops or
                      priests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      IV. Confession /Reconciliation <br />a. We acknowledge
                      that a sincere prayer of sorrow to our God will bring the
                      response for His forgiveness. We also believe that Christ
                      left us a special sacrament which is a powerful encounter
                      with Jesus Christ and His loving forgiveness. Also called
                      the Sacrament of Reconciliation, Penance can be celebrated
                      in two ways: <br />i. Individual absolution is usually
                      preceded by a Christian&rsquo;s confession of personal
                      sins. The priest&rsquo;s prayer of forgiveness or
                      absolution is said for each sincere penitent, at which
                      time his additional gift of grace is imparted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ii. General Absolution is sacramental absolution, given
                      once to a large number of people, especially when the
                      number of penitents is too great to allow for individual
                      confession of sins. General absolution may be granted at
                      the beginning of Mass but should not replace annual
                      confession and reconciliation. The ordinary ministers of
                      the sacrament are Bishops or priests

                    <p>
                      V. Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick <br />a. The
                      Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick consists of the
                      anointing of sick members of the Christian community with
                      oil and prayers for their healing and forgiveness. The
                      effects of this sacrament are strength and peace for the
                      Christian in the face of illness, physical healing and
                      recovery according to God&rsquo;s will. The ordinary
                      ministers of the sacrament are Bishops or priests. In
                      extraordinary circumstances and with the permission of the
                      Diocesan Bishop a deacon may anoint the sick.

                      VI. The Sacrament of Matrimony <br />a. Marriage,
                      understood as a permanent covenant between two baptized
                      persons, is a sacrament of the Church. As a covenant,
                      marriage is a lifelong, permanent commitment, embodying
                      obligations that transcend the immediate feelings or
                      wishes of the spouses. By coming to restore the original
                      order of creation disturbed by sin, Christ himself gives
                      the strength and grace to live marriage in the new
                      dimension of the Reign of God. <br />b. Recognizing the
                      nearly complete breakdown of moral norms in this society,
                      the Church understands that many persons will come to her
                      having experienced the tragedy of divorce. It is the
                      commitment of the Church and her bishops, in every case,
                      to work toward the healing and restoration of the marriage
                      covenant. <br />c. The Ministers of the Marriage are the
                      two individuals that are entering into marriage. The
                      Bishop, Priest or Deacon is there to witness and bless the
                      Sacrament of Marriage. Local governmental policies and
                      procedures must be followed in the completing, signing and
                      filing of the Marriage Certificate. <br />d. The Deacon,
                      Priest or Bishop should meet with the couple in advance of
                      the Marriage to explain the Sacrament to both individuals
                      entering into the bond of marriage. The meeting/meetings
                      can also be used to counsel or instruct the couple in the
                      Christian Life and the responsibilities of Marriage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      e. It is not possible to perform the Sacrament of Marriage
                      for same sex couples not recognized by local, state,
                      federal or international governments. The OSB will not
                      consider this a valid sacramental marriage even though
                      local, state, and the federal governments approve it.
                      <br />f. Both individuals must enter into bond of the
                      marriage of their free will. <br />g. Individual may be in
                      a current legal or sacramental marriage. Divorced
                      individuals is a law to may be remarried in the Church
                      with an annulment approved. <br />h. The Sacrament of
                      Matrimony may take place within the Nuptial Mass before
                      the Canon of the Mass. The Sacrament of Matrimony may also
                      be performed outside of the Mass. The Sacrament of
                      Matrimony may be celebrated outside of the church building
                      in other appropriate settings. <br />i. The individuals
                      entering to Marriage do not have to be current members of
                      the OSB. We recommend that they are members of the Church
                      but it is not a requirement. <br />j. Each Marriage must
                      be recorded as a permanent record of the parish of the
                      cleric who performed it. <br />k. The ordinary ministers
                      of the sacrament are Bishop, priests, or deacons.

                    <p>
                      VII. Holy Orders <br />a. It is the Sacrament of Holy
                      Orders through which the Church sets aside people for the
                      special service of ministry to the Christian community.
                      This sacramental act is called ordination. There are three
                      ranks or major orders in the ministry of the Church
                      including the faculties each order holds. All ordained
                      ministers in the Church are called to functions of Word,
                      Sacrament, and Charity, but bishops, presbyters and
                      deacons exercise these functions in various ways. The
                      ordinary ministers of the sacrament are Bishops. They are:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      i. Deacon: <br />1. A deacon can be permanent with no
                      aspirations of continuing to the priesthood. There is no
                      functional difference between permanent and transitional
                      deacons and the ordination is the same. Someone who is
                      designated a transitional deacon is not given a guaranteed
                      progression to the priesthood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      2. As ministers of Word, deacons proclaim the Gospel,
                      preach the homily, and teach in the name of the Church. As
                      ministers of Sacrament, deacons baptize, lead the faithful
                      in prayer, witness marriages, and conduct wake and funeral
                      services. <br />3. The Deacon is required to pray the
                      Office of his choice daily. It is suggested that the
                      office be Morning and Evening Prayer. To be obedient in
                      matters of the Church, first to Gods Law of Love, but also

                      rubrics approved by the Orden de San Benito. To refrain
                      from any activity that lends scorn or contempt to the
                      Church, Diocese or College of Bishops. These faculties may
                      be rescinded at any time by the Ordinary of the local
                      Diocese. <br />4. A deacon may carry the Blessed Sacrament
                      in a Pyx for those that are infirmed or homebound. The
                      Deacon with the permission of the Ordinary may anoint the
                      sick. A Deacon may be permitted to keep the Blessed
                      Sacrament in his or her home. The consecrated hosts must
                      be kept in a tabernacle with a sanctuary lamp that burns
                      around the clock. The sanctuary lamp may be electric or
                      candle.
                    </p>

                      to hear confessions and grant Sacramental Absolution.

                      Canon Seven: Principle of Human Dignity
                    </h4>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                      I. Human Dignity is the intrinsic worth that inheres in
                      every human being. The source of human dignity is rooted
                      in the concept of humanity created in the Image of God, in
                      Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and in our ultimate destiny of
                      union with God. Human dignity therefore transcends any
                      social order as the basis for rights and is neither
                      granted by society nor can it be legitimately violated by
                      society. In this way, human dignity is the conceptual
                      basis for human rights. <br />II. The OSB therefore
                      asserts that every human being should be acknowledged as
                      an inherently valuable member of the human community and
                      as a unique expression of life, with an integrated bodily
                      and spiritual nature. <br />III. The normative
                      implications of this conception of human dignity impacts
                      much of Catholic moral thought as it pertains to a range
                      of human life issues, including healthcare ethics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      IV. The principle is the foundation for our traditions
                      understanding of: <br />a. Right to Life: <br />i. We
                      therefore define abortion and euthanasia as sins against
                      the Image of God. We further define and declare that life
                      begins at conception we therefore mourn the loss of those
                      children and thus offer support to those individuals whom
                      have felt forced to make this decision, offering rebirth
                      and forgiveness through the reception of the Sacraments.
                      We declare that life ends with natural death however; pain
                      assistance under the care of a physician or the choice not
                      to pursue extreme medical intervention is an
                      individual&rsquo;s choice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      b. Right to Healthcare: <br />i. We support the right for
                      all individuals, especially children, the elderly and the
                      disabled to have access to adequate basic necessities like
                      food, shelter and medical attention. We encourage our
                      membership to work with and support agencies within their
                      dioceses dedicated to this endeavor.
                    </p>
                    <p>c. Right to Contraception:</p>
                    <p>
                      i. We do not support the use of condoms and other
                      artificial means of contraception in order to reduce
                      unwanted pregnancy and to reduce unnecessary abortion and
                      promote good health practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      d. Right to Gender Equality: <br />i. The Church teaches
                      and believes that our world is made up of diverse
                      individuals from all walks of life. Each person is honored
                      and treated with dignity for the way they choose to
                      identify.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      e. Right of Marriage Equality: <br />i. We support the
                      right of any two individuals who love each other and wish
                      to join themselves in marriage. Our clergy will marry only
                      following the teach of the bible and the father's of the
                      church, heterosexual marriage is right of all human been.
                      But same gender couples is an illegal and against the
                      teaching of the church. Same gender They will not also
                      request bless marriages by the church even if same gender
                      marriage is legal within the State that a couple resides.

                      members and must be approved by the College of Bishops.
                      <br />c. The Bishop Visitor or Protector shall be the
                      guardian of the Constitution of the Order and shall serve
                      as an arbiter in matters in which the Order or its members
                      cannot resolve through its normal processes. <br />d. Any
                      person(s) under vows in a Religious Order, having
                      exhausted the normal processes of the Order, may petition
                      the Bishop Moderator for dispensation from those vows.
                      <br />e. Each Calendar Year a General Chapter will be
                      called by the head of each religious order. Reports
                      generated from the Chapter should be submitted to the
                      Bishop Moderator within 30 days of the Chapters
                      conclusion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      II. Third Order Regular (TOR) <br />a. Diocese and
                      parishes are permitted to form Third Order Regular
                      associations/groups (TOR) comprised of clergy and laity.
                      The Diocesan Bishop will serve as the Bishop Moderator for
                      the TOR. Each TOR will have the freedom to elect their
                      guardians and chose a rule and habit suitable to their
                      lifestyle and station in life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      b. In relation to religious orders, a third order is an
                      association of persons who live according to the ideals
                      and spirit of an order, but do not belong to its "first
                      order" or its "second order" (contemplative nuns
                      associated with the "first order"). Members of third
                      orders, known as tertiaries (Latin tertiarii, from
                      tertius, third), are generally laypersons and clergy, i.e.
                      men and women who do not take religious vows, but
                      participate in the good works of order.

                      fellowship with all Christian bodies everywhere and to
